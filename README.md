## Jackbox Sorter

This is a simple site made to help you out with finding the right Jackbox Games for your group of friends. I noticed that there isn't a good repository of Jackbox Games sorted by player number and rough summary, so I made this. If there is anything you'd like to add, please message me on twitter @AdamNicewarner, and I'll do my best to fix it.
